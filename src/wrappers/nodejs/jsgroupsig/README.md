A native addon of libgroupsig (a library for group signatures) for NodeJS.

It is built using cmake-js, so you need a local installation of CMake in order
to install it.

Please go to [the Github repo](https://github.com/IBM/libgroupsig/wiki) for 
more information, including a tutorial on how to use it.
